%p Eve Ranch's Fleet Tracker lets you track and visualize where the members of your fleet are during a roam, in text or map form. Keep track of your scouts, and watch out for stragglers. Scouts can add their recon reports directly as well.
%p You must be using the Eve in-game-browser to list or create fleets. If you're already in a fleet, copy the direct fleet URL while in-game and view the fleet directly out of game.
